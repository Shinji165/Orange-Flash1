Toei Co. Ltd. Presents

2
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:24,918
Stop it! Please. Forgive me.

3
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,848
Don't kill me. Please.

4
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:31,458
For God's sake, please.

5
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,795
Here. Captain Sminny!

6
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,274
Over here.

7
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:08,412
This is the victim.

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,978
Same way as the last case.

9
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,654
Chief, it looks like it's the same killer.

10
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,171
Let's get going.

11
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,953
Only one minute to go.
No ship in sight.

12
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,554
He won't show up.

13
00:02:58,294 --> 00:02:59,534
Golgo 13!

14
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,504
I was expecting you. I'm Rocky Brown.

15
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,453
Sorry. I should know not to shake hands.

16
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,455
You don't give your hand to others.

17
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,816
That's Golgo 13.

18
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:17,656
It's a sinister name.

19
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:21,465
It means the 13th man who gave
the crown of thorns to Christ,

20
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:25,144
and drove him to death on Golgotha Hill.

21
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,563
That's the origin of his name.

22
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:31,000
He won't attract attention in Hong Kong.

23
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,801
Is he Japanese?

24
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,191
I don't know.

25
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:39,814
His nationality, real name, age
and birthplace are unknown.

26
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:43,450
All we know is that he speaks seven languages.

27
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:48,055
He's a perfect professional sniper
who never misses his target.

28
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,595
Golgo 13, what are you doing?

29
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,737
They're my men.

30
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,756
He's aiming at us.

31
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:20,303
It's 500 metres away.
The bullet will never reach.

32
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:43,127
I sald this was a secret meeting.
- I'm sorry. Listen to me.

33
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,415
I'll pay another $50,000.

34
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,388
No one else can do this job.

35
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,640
Put out to sea.

36
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:56,556
I want you to rub out Chou,
our Hong Kong head man.

37
00:04:56,746 --> 00:05:00,068
He's supposed to process drugs
gathered in Southeast Asia

38
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,287
and send them to our US Headquarters.

39
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:07,951
But we've heard that he's selling
them through his own channels.

40
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,980
We ordered him to Headquarters, but he refused.

41
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,148
On top of that, he killed the killers
we sent after him.

42
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:25,452
Three able killers, you know.

43
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:29,059
We have to finish this job quickly,

44
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:31,704
as the Hong Kong Police are investigating.

45
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,872
Sminny, the drugs detective.

46
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,371
He's passionate about controlling drugs.

47
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,498
He's a tough one.

48
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,023
In between Sminny and us...

49
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:46,890
Chou may betray us for his own safety.
Get him before the police do.

50
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,528
Why?

51
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,773
I've memorised his face.

52
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,783
So you accept the job?

53
00:05:56,973 --> 00:06:00,967
$150,000 will be transferred
to your bank account in Switzerland.

What are you doing? Hey!

69

Who is your boss?

70
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,289
Move.

71
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:08,602
That way.

72
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:23,744
Stop it!
- Be quiet and line up.

73
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,746
Put your hands on the table.
Be quiet.

74
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,833
Hey. Turn around.

75
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:58,317
As I've explained, we've uncovered
a number of dope peddling routes.

76
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,721
Your conclusion?

77
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:04,080
They all boil down to the same man.

78
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:09,253
Who is it?
- He's a Hong Kong celebrity.

79
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:12,713
Chou... Lei... Feng.

80
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,636
Chou?

81
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,653
We'd better check it again.

82
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:24,868
Sminny, are you saying that Mr Chou
was involved in those killings?

83
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:26,077
Yes, I am.

84
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:30,519
The dead were from a US drugs
syndicate. Chou must be in trouble.

85
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,001
This is a chance to clear Hong Kong of drugs.

86
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,369
Any evidence?

87
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:38,510
They are clever, leaving no clear trace.

88
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:39,849
But Mr Chou is...

89
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:43,777
Chief. Stop calling him "Mr" Chou.

90
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:49,042
He's a big shot, involved
in many tourist businesses.

91
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,941
Be careful investigating him.

92
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,012
That's all.

93
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,100
We'd better search again.

94
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,936
Good evening.
- It's been a long time.

95
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:28,707
Welcome. Please make yourself at home.

96
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,987
How have you been?

97
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,416
Excuse me for a minute.

98
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,492
Have a good time.

99
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,291
Wonderful.

100
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:02,915
Mr Chou.

101
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,911
Headquarters seem to have sent another killer.

102
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,023
Who Is it?
- Our source doesn't know him.

103
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:14,035
Take it easy. We have a
complete list of HQ's killers.

104
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,503
We'll know once they are in Hong Kong.

105
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:20,759
Will they repeat the same errors
for the fourth time?

106
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,324
What do you mean?

107
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,564
They might have hired a new killer.

108
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,267
They need to do something different.

109
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:34,297
Don't worry. Hong Kong is my garden.

110
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,715
Any man they send will be
floating in the sea the next day.

111
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:43,732
Isn't that right, Chali, Nyudo?
I'm counting on you guys.

112
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:56,620
Ching, are the goods ready?

113
00:12:56,792 --> 00:13:00,490
They'll be shipped tomorrow
Will you check them?

114
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,700
All right, I'm coming now.

115
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,498
Sminny.

116
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:55,627
This is Lin-Li. I'm trailing Chou's car.

117
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:58,685
I just passed Water Road. I
think I'm onto something.

118
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:00,590
Be careful.

119
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,327
Contact me if anything happens.

120
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,504
Hello, Boss.

121
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,795
Is the purity okay?
- Yes, Boss.

122
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,843
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,179
Stand up!

124
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,408
Chief.

125
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,310
Any news?
- No.

126
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,791
Anything from her?
-No...

127
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,420
Call her again.

128
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,442
Calm down, Sminny.

129
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,341
How can I?

130
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:16,678
It's been two hours since
we lost communication.

131
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,023
Chief, let me arrest Chou.

132
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:22,260
What are you saying?

133
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,210
We can make up some excuse.

134
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,589
Kidnapping Lin-Li, or something.

135
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:29,459
If anything happens to her...

136
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:33,488
Calm down. She might be safe.

137
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,616
If we rush now, everything
we've done will be in vain.

138
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,227
Where are you going?

139
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,976
Sorry, we're closed.

140
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,377
Police. Move!

141
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,962
I'll be in trouble if I let you in, sir.

142
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,861
Even the police?
- Evening.

143
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:56,723
Welcome, Detective. Please come in.

144
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:03,147
Excuse his rudeness.

145
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:04,368
Bring sake.

146
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,682
I want to see your husband.

147
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,564
Urgent business?
- He knows.

148
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,104
I wonder if he is I, as he's quite busy...

149
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:14,128
Detective Sminny.
- Come to the station.

150
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,344
Me?
- Just come.

151
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,239
What did I do?
- Get ready.

152
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:19,859
Do you have a warrant?

153
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:25,110
I'm willing to co-operate with you
as a good citizen.

154
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:29,030
But it's an unjustifiable request, isn't it?

155
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:30,419
How about a drink?

156
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,664
We'll unmask you soon.

Mr Polansky, Poranian Consul,

164
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,311
and his daughter, Maria.

165
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,889
Here they are. Mr Polansky and Maria.

166
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,351
Thank you.

167
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,181
Let us play some Poranian folk songs for you.

168
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,891
Band, get ready.

169
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,535
Nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

170
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,903
I'm full. May I go and see the pictures?

171
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,051
Go ahead.

172
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,288
What's the matter?

173
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,935
You have the same eyes as the dragon.

174
00:21:45,153 --> 00:21:46,223
They look strong.

175
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:50,061
Maria, Papa is going.
- Already? No fun.

176
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,761
Let's go.

177
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,308
Excuse us.

178
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,367
You've been very good today, Maria.

179
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,610
Time to go home with your father.

180
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,094
Let's go.

181
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,881
You scoundrel! What have you done?

182
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,547
1told you not to touch my sister!

183
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:24,670
<i>Shut up!</i>

184
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,443
She killed herself because of you.

185
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,745
That's none of my business.

186
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,843
You brute!

187
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,804
I'll kill you.

188
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:37,774
I'll kill you.

189
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,646
Gunshots!

190
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:01,151
This way!

191
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,889
He's dead.
- He took three shots.

192
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:13,493
Did you see anything?
- Yeah.

193
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,791
I saw the moment he was shot.

194
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:20,834
He went that way.

195
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:24,554
What did he look like?
- A young man, flamboyantly dressed.

196
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:38,101
Excuse me.
- Captain!

197
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,990
Any witnesses?
- That couple.

198
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,547
Are you a tourist?
-Yes.

199
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,250
Your name and hotel, please.

200
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:56,453
Duke Togo. Room 1002, Melrie Hotel.

201
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:04,693
Who is she?

202
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:07,155
1 picked her up on the street.

203
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,677
Why did you save me?

204
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:34,170
Did you want me to tell the truth?
- I don't mean that.

205
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,017
Thank you very much.

206
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,574
Hand her over to us.

207
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:04,404
She killed our friend. She was his woman.

208
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,452
Get him.

209
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:28,851
How much does Sminny know?

210
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,893
What a nerve you've got!

211
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,004
I admire you, Detective.

212
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,341
But we won't kill you until you speak up.

213
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,772
What's the matter?

214
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,283
What happened?

215
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:02,074
A terrible guy has shown up.
Nyudo was shot in the forehead.

216
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:03,798
Was he killed?

217
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,747
He's awfully strong.
- What does he look like?

218
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:10,321
He's either Japanese or
Chinese, with sharp eyes.

219
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,253
He must be the new killer.

220
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,401
What? Go and get him.

221
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:16,778
Search every part of town.

222
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:19,430
HONG KONG PUBLIC POOL:
OPENS 10 AUGUST

223
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,502
Lin-Lit

224
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,579
This is Sminny.

225
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,660
Is that you, Lin-Li?

226
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:19,167
No, I'm not Lin-Li.
- Who is this?

227
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,276
We...

228
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:27,724
We came here to play and found this thing.

229
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,744
Where are you? Tell me.

230
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:35,294
We're at the scrapyard near the duck pond.

231
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:35,004
Stop shooting, Sminny!

232
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:39,211
Or the girl's dead.

233
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,589
Throw your gun away.

234
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,794
Shit!

235
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,220
Firel

236
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:19,852
I can't see.

237
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,514
Watch out!

238
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:39,939
Lin-Lit

239
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:43,802
What a mess, Chou.

240
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:49,265
But we left no trace. The plant blew up.

241
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:53,675
But you should be aware that
the police are getting close.

242
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:56,281
And you haven't dealt with the killer from HQ.

243
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:59,213
I have an idea about who the killer is.

244
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:00,818
Who is it?

245
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:04,764
He's an Oriental man with sharp eyes,
an amazing karate master.

246
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:09,110
He shot Nyudo right in the forehead.

247
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,400
Right in the forehead?

248
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,657
What's the matter?

249
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:16,439
He must be Golgo 13.

250
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:18,828
Golgo 137

251
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:22,657
You must have heard of him.
He's the top professional sniper.

252
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:26,228
If you know that much, you can easily find him.

253
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:29,301
No. He won't reveal himself.

254
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,384
He has never missed a target.

255
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,656
Do something, please.

256
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:39,187
An Oriental with sharp eyes...

257
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:44,149
All right. You go abroad and hide, Chou.

258
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:49,255
Wait till the storm is over, then come back here.

259
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:52,779
You have enough money to idle
for a couple of years, don't you?

260
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:55,157
I think so.

261
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,118
I'll make arrangements for you to fly out

262
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:02,418
after the pool opening ceremony tomorrow.

263
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,561
Do I still need to attend the ceremony?

264
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,229
Don't lose your courage.

265
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:10,731
Tomorrow is your day.
It can't be done without you.

266
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:18,125
It's for Lin-Li, who was killed.

267
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,516
Cough up your money. Don't be stingy.

268
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:22,918
Here's 10 bucks.

269
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,819
Hello? Hold the line.

270
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,738
Captain, it's for you.

271
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:39,355
Mr Sminny. Do you know Golgo 13?

272
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,702
Golgo 137

273
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,116
He isn't a stranger to you, is he?

274
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,101
Who the hell are you? What's your name?

275
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:52,260
Golgo 13 is in Hong Kong now.
Did you know that?

276
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,535
What?

277
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,884
That's all. Good night.

278
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,164
How was it?

279
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,309
Well done.

280
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,714
Who's Golgo 13?

281
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,894
A professional killer. He's in town.

282
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,767
Have you met him?

283
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:15,888
No. But he owes me something.

284
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,621
Three years ago
I was ordered to guard a diplomat.

285
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:24,025
We were informed that
Golgo 13 was targeting him.

286
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:27,836
The diplomat didn't want me around
but I never left his side.

287
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,435
But when he was about to leave...

288
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:45,750
Mr Wang.

289
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,726
Good morning.

290
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,654
Golgo 13 is here to kill Chou.

291
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:54,635
We have to arrest Chou before he's killed.

292
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:58,514
Chou killed Lin-Li, no doubt about it.
Get a warrant immediately.

293
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:01,804
OK. We'll bring him In. But
after the pool opening.

294
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,230
That'll be too late.

295
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:05,665
The ceremony is being held by the city.

296
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:09,775
The authorities won't arrest Chou, the donator.

297
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,910
Don't you see?

298
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:16,031
PUBLIC POOL
OPENING CEREMONY

299
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,914
To promote sports
and for citizens' health,

300
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:50,588
this pool is a magnificent present given to us.

301
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:57,207
Let me introduce Mr Chou,
who gave us this wonderful pool.

302
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,601
Hi.

303
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:19,508
To show our gratitude, we'd like
to present a bouquet to Mr Chou.

304
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,574
From Maria, the daughter of
Mr Polansky, the Poranian Consul.

305
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,377
Here you are.

306
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:28,870
Thank you.

307
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,834
To commemorate the opening,

308
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:40,959
we're holding a 100-meter race
with Olympic swimmers.

309
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,187
Mr Chou will fire the starter pistol.

310
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,790
Cuff him after this.
- Okay.

311
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,758
Ready!

312
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,653
Golgo 13 did it.

313
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,689
Hurry!

314
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:11,982
DENTAL CLINIC

315
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,241
CLOSED

316
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:17,442
Rocky Brown?
Who did you get to kill Chou?

317
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,056
What?

318
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:21,944
I didn't hire anyone but you.

319
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,461
No one has ever cheated me like that.

320
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:27,190
I would never cheat you.

321
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,585
I know full well what would happen
if I double-crossed you.

322
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,419
Believe me Golgo 13.

323
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,376
Who did it, anyway?

324
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:39,201
My target is the biggest boss
in Hong Kong, right?

325
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,394
Is there a boss above Chou?
- That would explain it.

326
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,228
Find the man and get him.

327
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,353
I'll pay another $100,000 into your bank account.

328
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,337
Please.

329
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:57,728
Who could it be?

330
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:09,185
Have you finished, Golgo?

331
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,501
This is too much.

332
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:15,659
Take it. It was a long distance call.

333
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,747
Thanks for coming.

334
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:22,500
You remind me of my younger days.

335
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,508
It's been 30 years since the war.

336
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:29,093
I've been wandering places with a gun.

337
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:33,402
I lost the chance to return to Japan,
and settled here in the end.

338
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,342
Stay here as long as you like.

339
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,365
It's an old man's whining.

340
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:09,975
Good evening.

341
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,727
I was here last night, too.

342
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:15,931
You were? Thank you. Enjoy the evening.

343
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:31,618
Good evening.

344
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:35,522
You were the one who
became friends with Maria.

345
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:39,872
You look happy, despite
your husband being dead.

346
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:44,453
Do you want to know why?

347
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:51,709
I can tell you only when we are alone.

348
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,428
Chou was worthless as a man.

349
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:30,123
He didn't deserve to be loved,
if he counldn't give me joy.

350
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,832
Who deserves it, then?

351
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:40,757
You, hon. It's you now.

352
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:47,340
I like a strong man like you.

353
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:14,063
Next time, make sure the killer
wears the same perfume as you.

354
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,877
Make the phone call.

355
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:24,940
There must be a man waiting for your report.

356
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:27,650
Tell him it's over.

357
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,812
This is Li-Hua.

358
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,777
Is it over?

359
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,238
Yes.

360
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:04,433
Was that the man you told me about?

361
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,407
Hello?

362
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:17,350
Li-Hua. What's the matter?

363
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:22,001
Hello? Hello? What's up, Li-Hua?

364
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,986
Anything new?
- Nothing.

365
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,303
A man who looks like Golgo
appeared at the airport.

366
00:43:27,454 --> 00:43:30,446
What?
- He's on a plane to Tokyo.

367
00:43:30,624 --> 00:43:32,535
Didn't they stop him?

368
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:36,139
No, his papers were impeccable,
so there was no excuse to.

369
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:41,963
Control tower.
- Stop the Tokyo plane.

370
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:43,626
It's too late.

371
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,558
It just took off on schedule.

372
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:05,274
One, two, three, four...

373
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:10,566
... five, six, seven, eight,

374
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:15,884
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen...

375
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,061
Oh, Uncle Dragon Eyes!

376
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,815
We are on the same plane.

377
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,803
That's beautiful

378
00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:34,402
Thank you, Uncle.

379
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:44,704
Uncle gave me this brooch.

380
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:46,526
How nice.

381
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,955
Hello, American Embassy?

382
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,842
Mr Arnold, the First Secretary, please.

383
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:11,177
This is Polansky. Just Polansky. He'll know.

384
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:15,969
I have urgent business.

385
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:21,045
With the ambassador? Where are you going?

386
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,202
TOKYO AIRPORT

387
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,989
I'm Tachibana, of Police International Liaison.

388
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,235
I'm Sminny.
- I'm Miki.

389
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,724
Brother!

390
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,032
<i>Hit</i>

391
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,831
Brother!

392
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,966
This is my sister. She's studying in Tokyo.

393
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:09,776
How are you?

394
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,686
Unfortunately, we missed Togo by a second.

395
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,358
I'm sorry for not being able to help.

396
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,450
Are you sure? Okay.

397
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,308
He stayed at the Asia Hotel last night.

398
00:46:40,481 --> 00:46:42,802
But he checked out this morning.

399
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:46,055
We noticed something.

400
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:50,467
Here's the ledger of the Asia Hotel.

401
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:54,322
We checked it against the passenger
list of his flight.

402
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:57,567
There was another person listed on both.

403
00:46:57,765 --> 00:46:58,960
Who was it?

404
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:03,297
Polansky, the Poranian Consul
in Hong Kong and his daughter.

405
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,381
Polansky? Where is he now?

406
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:10,738
He also went to Kyoto,
leaving the daughter at the hotel.

407
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:15,939
Who is this man named Duke Togo?

408
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:18,403
His last name sounds Japanese, but...

409
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:09,730
Brother, you're as daring as ever.
-Am 1?

410
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:12,565
Going to Kyoto straight after arriving in Tokyo.

411
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:15,561
Well, that gave me a reason to travel.

412
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,940
That's why you volunteered
to be my guide, huh?

413
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:24,545
You had a strong sense of
justice even as a child,

414
00:48:24,718 --> 00:48:26,129
but you were very rough.

415
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:32,266
Now yon're a cop going after a crook.
Could have been the other way round.

416
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:37,170
Silly. How long Is it to Kyoto?
- Two more hours.

417
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,030
A slow train.
- Oh?

418
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,113
This bullet train is running at 200km/h.

419
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,291
KYOTO POLICE

420
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:04,877
Good day, sir.

421
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:22,386
I have to go now. Enjoy sightseeing.

422
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:28,042
You found the criminal?
- Show me the town next time.

423
00:49:28,482 --> 00:49:30,803
Take care.
- You, too.

424
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:33,396
Say hello to the Hong Kong people.

425
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,434
Goodbye.

426
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:59,949
I want asylum in the US, as I'm in danger.

427
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:04,929
You can count on my great souvenirs.

428
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:09,008
The FBI will be excited.

429
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:11,055
What are the souvenirs?

430
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:15,330
The list of who's In the drug
syndicates in the US and Hong Kong.

431
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:17,478
The reply?

432
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:20,039
The matter is serious.

433
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,149
I need time to consult with our ambassador first.

434
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:29,503
Wait for my reply in Hong Kong.

435
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:37,995
Mister, they say this is a serious matter.

436
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:41,052
Rocky told me to help you...

437
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:46,937
But this Is an expensive case,
to save our organisation.

438
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:53,494
I may not see you again. Bye.

439
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:21,413
Duke Togo.

440
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:24,587
Or Golgo 131 You're under
arrest for murdering Chou.

441
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:27,135
I have other questions.

442
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:30,980
Why stay In the same hotel
as Polansky, here and in Tokyo?

443
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,082
It can't be a coincidence.

444
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,313
This Is not Hong Kong. You
have no jurisdiction here.

445
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,822
You are right. The Japanese
police should be here.

446
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:50,154
Wait.

447
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:41,247
Take it out.

448
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,721
Together with an infrared alarm system,

449
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,582
even an ant can't get in.

450
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:56,865
Neither can the FBI.

451
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,168
You've done a good job, Gaston.

452
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:02,970
Your crisis is my crisis.

453
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,925
You want us to investigate Polansky?

454
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:18,799
He's definitely Golgo's next target.

455
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:22,090
We can't lose him, after Chou.

456
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:24,221
Why is Polansky a target?

457
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:29,064
Golgo knows the reason, He's
surely back in Hong Kong.

458
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:32,229
Get me around 15 men.

459
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:37,751
Fifteen? An excellent detective like
you needs so many to catch a sniper?

460
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:41,872
All the cops In the Hong
Kong Police are excellent.

461
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:47,541
You don't realise who Golgo 13 is.

462
00:54:48,335 --> 00:54:51,657
He's the strongest man I've ever met.

463
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,034
He calculates everything precisely.

464
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:25,919
Did you find him?
- No.

465
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:30,754
He can't stay in a hotel.
He must be around here.

466
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:17,150
Chen speaking. We found Golgo.

467
00:56:17,991 --> 00:56:20,688
Roger. Arrest him,
- Without a warrant?

468
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,055
Arrest him, I said.

469
00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:24,399
He seems to have a gun.

470
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:27,970
Stop him for questioning.

471
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:30,145
I'll do it.
- Go ahead!

472
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:34,109
He's heading your way.

473
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:35,976
Men, after Golgo!

474
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:37,912
Roger!
- Roger.

475
00:56:57,764 --> 00:56:59,084
That's him.

476
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,600
This way.

477
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,202
What is he doing?

478
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:13,416
That's Golgol Get him!

479
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:20,395
He got off the bus and
is heading to Yumachil. After him!

480
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:22,158
Roger. That way.

481
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:23,745
Mister. She's calling you.

482
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:33,252
Why did you run away?

483
01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:38,470
You killed Chou, eh? Spit it out!

484
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,059
How long will you keep silent?
"No comment" won't pass here.

485
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:47,415
Why, you!

486
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:55,529
We know you're the fourth sniper
hired by the US syndicate.

487
01:00:55,702 --> 01:00:58,399
But why are you after Polansky?

488
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:00,471
Is it the syndicate's request?

489
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:04,292
Why are you after him? What's your intention?

490
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:11,315
It's all right to stay quiet forever.

491
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,599
Polansky will be safe as long as you are here.

492
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:20,783
Even you can't shoot him
from a police cell, can you?

493
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:30,476
We have plenty of time.

494
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,788
It's a game of endurance, between you and me.

495
01:02:12,345 --> 01:02:15,633
You've held out overnight, Togo.

496
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:17,978
But there's a long way to go.

497
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,966
Don't forget that this is Hong Kong.

498
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:25,669
Captain!
- What is it?

499
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:28,771
Mr Wang wants you. Keep watch.

500
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:35,270
Are you releasing him?

501
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:40,157
We lost our reason for keeping him.
He didn't kill Chou.

502
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:45,847
The bullets from Chou's body and in
Li's room were from a Magnum Special.

503
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:49,413
<i>What's Golgo's gun?
- Armalite MAS.</i>

504
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:55,657
The dead woman was a notorious
South American killer.

505
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:56,892
Who killed her?

506
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,160
I don't know.

507
01:02:58,324 --> 01:03:01,487
There's no evidence, even if Golgo did it.

508
01:03:04,997 --> 01:03:06,408
Captain!

509
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:09,921
He's free to go.
- Really? But why?

510
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:12,848
It can't be helped.

511
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:16,590
We have information that
Polansky is on the move.

512
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,760
Track him down.

513
01:03:19,946 --> 01:03:21,311
We're counting on you.

514
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,677
He's going to the US Embassy.

515
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,636
What? Why...

516
01:03:25,818 --> 01:03:27,604
Wait.

517
01:03:27,787 --> 01:03:30,950
He doesn't say anything unnecessary.
Chen, watch him.

518
01:04:21,307 --> 01:04:23,253
I've been waiting for you, Golgo 13.

519
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:27,277
I knew you would be released from
the police, for lack of evidence.

520
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:33,634
It was your plan to stay in custody,
but you didn't expect me.

521
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,515
What can you do with no weapon?

522
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:04,256
Go to hell!
Tell them Schlitz did it, Golgo 13.

523
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:41,602
Who ordered you?

524
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:47,533
You knew it's difficult to aim at a falling object.

525
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,217
We lost Golgo.

526
01:06:29,302 --> 01:06:32,044
This is Sminny. Join us immediately.

527
01:06:32,805 --> 01:06:33,624
Roger.

528
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:49,431
He'll try to run to the US Embassy.
Don't let him.

529
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:53,219
But no violence.

530
01:06:58,731 --> 01:07:01,143
USA GENERAL CONSULATE
HONG KONG

531
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:21,626
No good. Hurry!

532
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:31,673
Keep on chasing him.

533
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:36,664
Captain! Let's break in there.

534
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:40,823
Diplomatic immunity. We can't go any further.

535
01:08:46,972 --> 01:08:50,010
The man from the other day is injured. There.

536
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:15,703
Come on.

537
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:32,037
Terrible wounds! You must see a doctor at once.

538
01:09:32,218 --> 01:09:34,539
No doctor. Get me a knife.

539
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:24,855
Bandages.

540
01:10:41,453 --> 01:10:44,525
We got some reports on Polansky.

541
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,510
Laos, Burma, Thailand...

542
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:51,016
Various Asian countries
have been sending him presents.

543
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:55,645
They passed Customs without inspection.

544
01:10:55,801 --> 01:10:57,621
They must have been drugs.

545
01:10:57,803 --> 01:11:02,252
Chou and Li-Hua were close to Polansky.

546
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,512
Arrest him before he escapes to the US.

547
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,214
But there's the diplomatic immunity.

548
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,339
Extra-territorial rights and diplomatic immunity.

549
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,839
He's dealing drugs under
those rights. Arrest him.

550
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,138
I'm sorry, Captain, for losing Golgo
at such a vital time.

551
01:11:18,324 --> 01:11:21,316
That's all right. He hasn't done his job yet.

552
01:11:21,493 --> 01:11:25,111
We'll have another chance to catch Golgo.

553
01:11:25,297 --> 01:11:27,038
We'll get him.

554
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,827
Are you feeling any better?

555
01:11:49,188 --> 01:11:51,680
You don't say a word.

556
01:11:51,857 --> 01:11:54,349
You don't ask me anything, either.

557
01:11:56,762 --> 01:11:59,254
Even though you know I'm...

558
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:01,502
a murderer.

559
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:08,017
They say the man I killed was my pimp.

560
01:12:09,174 --> 01:12:11,916
But he was worse than a pimp, a dirty flea.

561
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:17,952
He had many other girls.

562
01:12:19,618 --> 01:12:23,282
But he clung to me just for money.

563
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:30,814
I was wrong, too.

564
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:34,001
Living dirty on a boat like this,

565
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:37,021
I was prone to fall for the wrong man.

566
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:41,275
That's the fate of a woman like me.

567
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:49,555
1 fall for anyone who can say sweet words.

568
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:53,195
I was lonely. But my sister was different.

569
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:56,252
She was only 15.

570
01:12:56,422 --> 01:12:59,289
That scoundrel raped her.

571
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,829
And she killed herself.

572
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,534
I couldn't forgive him.

573
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,097
Your first shot was from anger.

574
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,762
The second from fear.

575
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:16,773
The third from love.

576
01:13:17,443 --> 01:13:20,811
You didn't want him to suffer.

577
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:36,855
Hold me. Hold me tight.

578
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,977
You're able to stand up.

579
01:14:12,965 --> 01:14:14,000
Who are you?

580
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:22,936
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

581
01:14:24,743 --> 01:14:27,155
Let's celebrate your recovery.

582
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:30,309
I'll prepare a feast.

583
01:14:34,153 --> 01:14:36,690
They look nice.

584
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:39,685
I'll buy some of these.

585
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:42,546
Thank you.

586
01:15:03,115 --> 01:15:04,560
Captain, I found the girl.

587
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:09,411
Look at these, so many...

588
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:54,235
Who are you?
- Come on out!

589
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:55,673
What are you doing?

590
01:15:57,402 --> 01:15:59,689
What are you doing? Stop it.

591
01:15:59,838 --> 01:16:01,829
Where's Golgo?
- I don't know.

592
01:16:02,007 --> 01:16:04,749
Where did he go? Where are you hiding him?

593
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:07,014
I don't know.
- Spit it out!

594
01:16:07,179 --> 01:16:08,214
Hold it.

595
01:16:09,114 --> 01:16:12,652
He won't return here. He's gone.

596
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,693
He's gone after his target.

597
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:43,292
Wet suits, a rope, an underwater gun...

598
01:16:43,482 --> 01:16:45,428
And Armalite M16, eh?

599
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:49,815
I need more power. Get me an Anschutz 22.

600
01:16:50,455 --> 01:16:53,152
Your orders are always urgent and difficult.

601
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:55,145
By tonight, okay?

602
01:16:55,327 --> 01:16:56,488
Tonight?

603
01:16:57,129 --> 01:16:59,871
What are you going to do?

604
01:17:07,172 --> 01:17:11,461
Sorry, I shouldn't question you.

605
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:30,196
Sminny, please.

606
01:17:30,996 --> 01:17:32,282
What?

607
01:17:33,599 --> 01:17:36,091
Who is this speaking?

608
01:17:36,268 --> 01:17:37,554
Hello? Hold the line.

609
01:17:44,443 --> 01:17:48,391
Polansky has left his consul
and sought shelter at Sekirei Island.

610
01:17:49,514 --> 01:17:52,302
Please make the necessary arrangements.

611
01:17:52,451 --> 01:17:54,522
No more investigation.
- What?

612
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,212
An order from above. The
FBI will take care of him.

613
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:01,337
Polansky's asylum request
to the US was successful.

614
01:18:01,526 --> 01:18:04,973
The list of the drug syndicates served him well.

615
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,121
The FBI will do a round-up.

616
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,942
That may settle the American side.

617
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,549
But what about us, the Hong Kong Police?

618
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:16,606
Leaving us this drug network...

619
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,812
The very top man is running away.

620
01:18:20,078 --> 01:18:22,945
Do we just watch him go?

621
01:18:23,582 --> 01:18:25,493
Without doing anything?

622
01:18:25,651 --> 01:18:29,895
I'll get Polansky with my own hands.

623
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:32,409
It's a superior's order. Don't ignore it.

624
01:18:33,425 --> 01:18:35,462
I'm prepared to be fired.

625
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:40,497
I won't get you in any trouble.

626
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:14,193
Boss. It's nearly time.

627
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:15,561
Yes.

628
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:19,056
A boat should be arriving soon.

629
01:19:19,204 --> 01:19:21,946
The FBI's special boat.

630
01:19:23,141 --> 01:19:25,428
You'll be in the States soon.

631
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,477
Please make arrangements for me, too.

632
01:19:29,047 --> 01:19:31,414
Why, of course.

633
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:40,099
Gaston, This island Is in
your hands in the meantime.

634
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:44,744
The Hong Kong Police have retreated.
Golgo is missing.

635
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:47,638
It's safe, hiding here.

636
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,313
We owe everything to this file.

637
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:04,196
I get it.

638
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,654
Boss, the boat is coming.

639
01:20:07,953 --> 01:20:08,988
So early?

640
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:12,827
<i>Oh, the cops!</i>

641
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,145
Come on.

642
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:41,017
Hong Kong Police?
- What?

643
01:20:42,154 --> 01:20:44,816
It must be Sminny.

644
01:20:56,835 --> 01:20:57,870
What's wrong?

645
01:21:45,684 --> 01:21:49,552
Don't let them get down from here.

646
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:52,759
You guys, follow me.

647
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,123
Damn. The FBI boat can't reach the island.

648
01:22:49,281 --> 01:22:50,567
What about the back?

649
01:22:57,422 --> 01:22:58,457
It's infested, too.

650
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:18,191
What's up?
- He shot our cameras.

651
01:23:38,897 --> 01:23:40,092
Isn't Golgo here?

652
01:23:40,966 --> 01:23:42,832
Not yet, Captain.

653
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,975
Golgo will be here, for sure.

654
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,771
Damn you.

655
01:25:09,421 --> 01:25:10,240
Wait.

656
01:25:14,325 --> 01:25:17,397
Haven't you found Sminny yet?

657
01:25:17,562 --> 01:25:21,226
Stop being so slow. Get Sminny.

658
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:23,515
Find him quickly.

659
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,773
I'll go. Get a helicopter.

660
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:27,569
Right away, Boss.

661
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,776
Boss, they've broken in. The cops are coming.

662
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,661
Damn it.

663
01:26:17,155 --> 01:26:20,568
Leave it to me, Boss. I have an idea.

664
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,720
Where's Polansky? That's Polansky. After him!

665
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:42,603
Polansky Is trying to escape.
- What!

666
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,440
After that boat!

667
01:27:07,338 --> 01:27:10,160
Stop the boat!

668
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:14,798
We order you to stop the boat.

669
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,390
Stop the boat.

670
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:22,343
We order you to stop the boat.

671
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:29,270
Stop it!
- Stop!

672
01:27:37,402 --> 01:27:39,143
The trap worked.

673
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:43,331
Damn! It's not Polansky. It's a decoy.

674
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,169
We were tricked?

675
01:27:58,723 --> 01:28:02,011
Golgo. He must have been
waiting for that helicopter.

676
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:38,531
Hurry up! Go back.

677
01:28:54,112 --> 01:28:56,103
I'm Watson, FBI.
- Polansky.

678
01:28:56,281 --> 01:28:58,602
I'm Marla.
- Hurry, please.

679
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,005
Do you like helicopters?

680
01:30:14,359 --> 01:30:16,976
Get over there! Quick!

681
01:30:19,597 --> 01:30:24,387
Golgo had guessed Polansky
would take a helicopter

682
01:30:24,569 --> 01:30:28,984
to break through the Hong Kong Police cordon.

683
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:34,535
He knew that the helicopter
would fly over this cliff

684
01:30:34,712 --> 01:30:38,080
Judging from the weather conditions,
the direction of the wind

685
01:30:38,249 --> 01:30:42,994
and the information Shigemune had given him.

686
01:30:43,554 --> 01:30:48,128
It was an unerring judgment by a super sniper.

687
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:50,738
Everything went as he had guessed.

688
01:30:50,928 --> 01:30:53,499
And it was all over.

689
01:31:55,326 --> 01:31:59,570
Golgo 13, I couldn't pin anything on you after all.

690
01:32:00,331 --> 01:32:04,325
But I'll catch you if you
come to Hong Kong again.

691
01:32:26,224 --> 01:32:29,387
THE END
